# Ytmusic_analitycs_V2
This project is a personal product &amp; tech sandbox to turn my YouTube Music history into a real analytics product. I use it to practice end-to-end Product Owner work (user research, user stories, iterations, backlog) combined with data engineering and dashboarding (ETL, data model, BI).
